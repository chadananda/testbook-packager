# To add a new book, drop in a ZIP file containing HTML and Audio

* The HTML can reference assets but they must all be contained in an 'assets' folder
* The HTML can have any file name but the audio file must have the same file (with different ext)

### For example, a ZIP file named "my-book.zip" might contain:

  this-is-my-book.html
  /assets
  this-is-my-book.flac
